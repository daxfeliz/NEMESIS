NEMESIS I was used in Feliz et al. 2021 for detection of transits in TESS Full Frame Images of M-dwarf stars in Sectors 1 - 5. 

NEMESIS II (under construction, Feliz et al. 2024) will be used for detection of transits in TESS Full Frame Images of M-dwarf stars in the full TESS primary mission (Sectors 1-26).
